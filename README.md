# 🛹 RAMEN4ROBOTS

A fast-paced VR skating game built around speed, flow, and momentum.
Heavily inspired by Sonic the Hedgehog and Jet Set Radio.

If you’re curious to see it in action, check out the [Gameplay and DevLogs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ3y7VoZK-4M_FGsmGoOwaoK2rG7UcLKG) and [Discord](http://discord.com/invite/zX2XRPvDt5).

## 🚧 Project Status:

This version of the project is **no longer actively developed**.

That said, the repository is intentionally kept public and maintained as:
- A **learning resource** for developers interested in movement systems specifically made for VR.
- A reference for VR locomotion, skating physics, and momentum-based design.
- A base for creating **custom levels, or experiments**.

## 🛠 Using This Project

You are welcome to:
- Study the code.
- Experiment with mechanics.
- Create your own custom levels.
- Build your own prototypes on top of it.

Please see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/RealityWanderers/R4R_Public/tree/main?tab=License-1-ov-file) for details on what is and isn’t allowed. Especially regarding assets and third-party packages.

## 🌍 Community & Support

While this version is discontinued, development has continued in the form of a spiritual successor.
More information, including explanations of the code and a look at the newer project can be found on the [Discord](http://discord.com/invite/zX2XRPvDt5).

The Discord is also the place to be if you want:
- Breakdowns of how specific systems work
- Design insights behind the movement mechanics
- A peek at the new iteration of the project
- Or just to hang out with fellow Sonic and Jet Set Radio enjoyers
