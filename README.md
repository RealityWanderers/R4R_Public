# 🛹 RAMEN4ROBOTS

A **fast-paced VR skating game** focused on speed, flow, and momentum. 
Heavily inspired by **Sonic** and **Jet Set Radio**.

Feel free to check out the [Gameplay and DevLogs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ3y7VoZK-4M_FGsmGoOwaoK2rG7UcLKG) if you are interested in learning more.

## 🚧 Project Status:

This version of the project is **no longer actively developed**.

However, the repository is being shared intentionally as:
- A **learning resource** for developers interested in movement systems specifically made for VR.
- A reference for VR locomotion, skating physics, and momentum-based design.
- A base for creating **custom levels, or experiments**.

## 🛠 Using This Project

You are welcome to:
- Study the code.
- Experiment with mechanics.
- Create your own custom levels.
- Build your own prototypes on top of it.

Please see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/RealityWanderers/R4R_Public/tree/main?tab=License-1-ov-file) section for details on what is and isn’t allowed, especially regarding assets and third-party packages.

## 🌍 Community & Support

Even though this version is discontinued, development **has continued** on a spiritual successor.
More information on that can be found over at the [Discord](http://discord.com/invite/zX2XRPvDt5).
Which is also the place to be if you want:
- Explanations of how the code works.
- Design insights behind the movement systems.
- To see what the **new version** of the project looks like.
- Or just to hang out and chat with other people interested in Sonic and Jet Set Radio.
